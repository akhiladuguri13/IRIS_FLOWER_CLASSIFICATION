🌸 Iris Flower Classification Web App

An interactive Machine Learning web application that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on user-provided measurements.

This project uses the classic Iris flower dataset to classify flowers into:

🌼 Setosa

🌺 Versicolor

🌸 Virginica

The model is trained using Scikit-learn and deployed as a web app using Streamlit.

📌 Project Highlights

🔹 Supervised Machine Learning Classification

🔹 Trained using Scikit-learn

🔹 Model saved using Joblib

🔹 Interactive UI built with Streamlit

🔹 Ready for cloud deployment

🧠 How It Works

The model takes four input features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Based on these measurements, the trained model predicts the correct Iris species instantly.
