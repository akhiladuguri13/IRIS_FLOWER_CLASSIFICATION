🌸 Iris Flower Classification Web App is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts the species of an Iris flower using sepal and petal measurements. Built using the classic Iris flower dataset, the model classifies flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica with high accuracy. The model was developed using Scikit-learn, serialized with Joblib, and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment — making it a strong portfolio project showcasing practical Machine Learning and web app integration skills.
